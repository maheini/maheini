#### My experiences so far

I initially started with microcontroller code, written in C, which gave me great insights. Later, I switched to QT and made a ERP software and many more projects there. With the release of Flutter, I switched over and started with desktop/mobile/web development. Besides that, I started digging into WordPress plugin development to expand my websites.
